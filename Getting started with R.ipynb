    "This workshop is a basic introduction to R, a free, open-source software for data analysis and statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "R is a powerful tool that can help you quickly and effectively answer questions using data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take our host city, New Orleans, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hurricane Katrina was a devastating natural disaster that substantially affected the population of New Orleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The hurricane took place in August 2005, which coincidentally falls between the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Censuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This allows us to measure the effect of the hurricane on the populations of the different areas of New Orleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Here are some questions we will set out to answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much did the population of New Orleans change between 2000 and 2010?\n",
    "* In which census tracts and parishes (Louisiana lingo for counties) did it change the most?\n",
    "* How did the occupancy of homes change in that time period?\n",
    "\n",
    "** We will use the Demographic Profiles for both years, downloaded from the [U.S. Census Bureau](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). ** \n",
    "\n",
    "** In this Getting Started session, we will: **\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load in the datasets\n",
    "* Perform some cleaning of the data\n",
    "* Select the variables of interest\n",
    "* Look at the Orleans Parish in particular, which represents New Orleans\n",
    "* Calculate the percent change in population between 2000 and 2010"
