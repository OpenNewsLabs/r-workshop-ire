    "*IRE Conference -- New Orleans, LA*\n",
    " \n",
    "June 18, 2016  \n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is a basic introduction to R, a free, open-source software for data analysis and statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "R is a powerful tool that can help you quickly and effectively answer questions using data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take our host city, New Orleans, for example. Hurricane Katrina was a devastating natural disaster that substantially affected the population of New Orleans. The hurricane took place in August 2005, which coincidentally falls between the U.S. Census full population counts in 2000 and 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will use the \"Demographic Profile” -- a large summary file with many different demographic variables downloaded from the [U.S. Census Bureau website](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) -- from 2000 and 2010, for all census tracts in the state of Louisiana.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this session, we will:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the 2000 data in R\n",
    "* Select a few variables pertaining to population counts and housing occupancy\n",
    "* Clean the data\n",
    "* Focus on the Orleans Parish in particular, which represents the city of New Orleans, and tally the population\n",
    "* Perform the same steps on the 2010 data\n",
    "* Merge the two sets\n",
    "* Write the merged data out to a CSV file for our next class, [More with R](More%20with%20R.ipynb), where we'll do some more in depth analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic analysis techniques like the ones you will learn in this class can help you write data-driven stories, like [this one written by The Times-Picayune](http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/02/new_orleans_officials_2010_pop.html) shortly after the census released its 2010 tally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story begins:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Five years after Hurricane Katrina emptied New Orleans and prompted the largest mass migration in modern American history, **the 2010 Census counted 343,829 people living in the still-recovering city, a 29 percent drop since the last head count a decade ago**, according to data released today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data we have, we will attempt to replicate the calculations in that lede.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code and annotations were written in a Jupyter notebook. The code is best run in RStudio using R version 3.3.0"

    "### Loading data\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by loading in the 2000 data, which is stored in a CSV (comma-separated values) file. CSVs are plain-text files of data where commas separate the columns within a line. It is sometimes preferable to work with CSVs as opposed to files of a proprietary format, such as Microsoft Excel files, but the Census Bureau readily makes data available in both formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run R's `read.csv` command and save the data to an object called `census2000`. Here, we are using assignment with `<-`, which tells R to run the right side and assign the result to the object named on the left. "
