Data + Code for Getting started with R &amp; More with R workshop at the [IRE conference](http://www.ire.org/conferences/ire-2016/) in New Orleans on Saturday, June 18th 2016

## Why R?

* R makes it easy to automate data cleaning and analysis tasks
* R by default leaves a trail of code that documents all the work you've done, unlike a program like Excel
* R has a nice user interface called RStudio, where you can write code, view data, perform analyses and even make visualizations
* R is free and open source

## Links to install R and RStudio

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/): website for the R software
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/): website for R Studio, a powerful graphical user interface for R

## How to use these files

* You can clone or download this repository by clicking on the green button above, "Clone or download"
* We recommend opening the .r files in RStudio while reading the .ipynb notebooks online by clicking the Github links above
